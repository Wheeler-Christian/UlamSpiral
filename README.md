The number 1 is gray so the eye knows where to start.
The prime numbers are all black, as usual.

Every multiple of 2 is colored red -- (except for 2, because it is prime, and hence already black)
    
Every multiple of 3 is colored orange -- (except for numbers which are already colored, such as primes and multiples of 2)

Every multiple of 5 is colored yellow -- (except for numbers which are already colored, such as primes, and multiples of 2, 3)

Every multiple of 7 is colored green -- (except for numbers which are already colored, such as primes, and multiples of 2, 3, 5)

Every multiple of 11 is colored blue -- (except for numbers which are already colored, such as primes, and multiples of 2, 3, 5, 7)
